        <p>
            In this clip named "F", we can see Connor trying to hit Ellee in a 360 then race her, but as the stupid idiot be is, he fails... He does not even hit Ellee and walks right off the bridge! Ellee proceeds with a "LOL" in chat and clip it. Connor was so embarassed as this was on stream. What an L.
